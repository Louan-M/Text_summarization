# Text summarization


![Summary](https://www.expert.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Document-summarization-software.jpg)



## Introduction

This is a python project for **Algorhythm**.

### Description and Objectives

A book publishing company is interested in increasing its online sales. The marketing department discovered the way people read is evolving and now rather than reading the full book, people prefer to get an overview of the main ideas expressed by the author. The digital era also means that customers want to get answers not from one book but from thousands immediately.

You have the task of developing an "AI-powered tool" able to "read" the content of any given book and make a summarization of the text. Also, the tool has to be deployed online since the company is looking to integrate the program into their website and connect it with the database where the books are stored.
### When?
It is a 2 weeks project.
The deadline to complete it is scheduled to `07/05/2021 at 9:30 a.m.`.
